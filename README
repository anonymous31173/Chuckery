This is a collection of scripts and toolkit classes for the ChucK music
programming language:

http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/

A lot of these are general utility things not included in the base language.  Also note
that many of them have an include syntax that's not supported in the base language and
require my preprocessor that's also here, "upchuck".
